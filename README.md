## Overview

Discovereye helps users find local, non-chain businesses in their area. The business catalog is populated from the OpenStreetMap Overpass API and spans approximately 550,000 lines of structured data across eight Canadian cities. Users can search, filter by category or geolocation radius, read and write reviews, save favorites into collections, track deals, make reservations, and interact with an AI-powered chat agent for personalized recommendations.

Business owners can verify their accounts to unlock management capabilities: creating deals, uploading 3D scans of their storefronts, publishing blog posts, and managing reservations.

- **Frontend (Electron):** Chromium-based desktop shell. The main process (`frontend/main.js`) spawns Flask as a child process, waits for it to become healthy, then loads the UI. All frontend code is vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using ES modules -- no build step or framework.
- **Backend (Flask):** 20 route blueprints registered on a single Flask application. Each blueprint maps to a core manager module that contains the domain logic. All data access goes through a shared `json_handler.py` utility.
- **Data Layer:** Flat JSON files in the `data/` directory. Binary uploads (images, 3D models, receipt photos) are stored under `data/uploads/` subdirectories.

The frontend communicates with the backend at `http://127.0.0.1:5001`. Session state is maintained via localStorage on the client side; the server tracks sessions in `data/sessions.json`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later
- Node.js 18 or later (for Electron)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Albertlungu/Discovereye.git
   cd Discovereye
   ```

2. Set up the Python virtual environment and install dependencies:

   macOS / Linux:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

   Windows:
   ```powershell
   .\setup.ps1
   ```

   Or manually:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install Electron dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

---

## Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and fill in your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The following variables are supported:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_ID` | For calendar features | OAuth client ID from Google Cloud Console |
| `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_SECRET` | For calendar features | OAuth client secret |
| `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_REDIRECT_URI` | For calendar features | Must match the authorized redirect URI in your Google project (default: `http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/calendar/callback`) |
| `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY` | Optional | Google reCAPTCHA v3 secret key for bot prevention |

Environment variables are loaded automatically by `python-dotenv` when the server starts.

---

## Running the Application

### Option 1: Electron (production-like)

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
cd frontend
npm start
```

This launches Electron, which automatically starts the Flask backend as a child process and opens the application window once the server is healthy.

### Option 2: Flask only (development)

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python run_server.py
```

The API server starts at `http://127.0.0.1:5001`. Open any of the HTML pages in `frontend/src/` directly in a browser pointed at that address (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5001/businesses.html`).

### Stopping

If you started the server via `start.sh`, use:
```bash
./stop.sh
```

## Data Storage

Discovereye uses flat JSON files rather than a database. This keeps the project portable and eliminates external service dependencies. All data files live in the `data/` directory and are read/written through a centralized `json_handler.py` utility.

The business catalog is sourced from the OpenStreetMap Overpass API via the scripts in `scripts/`. The population script queries for non-chain businesses in eight Canadian cities and outputs structured JSON conforming to the Pydantic `Business` model.

Binary uploads (receipt images, review photos, 3D models) are stored on disk under `data/uploads/` with metadata references in the corresponding JSON files.
